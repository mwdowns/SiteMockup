            <p>Right now I am lauging at you because I think you are funny and
              I think everyone is funny. The whole world is funny. Some folks
              might think I like The Joker for some reason, but really that
              guy is a psychotic asshole. No one likes that guy. And if you do,
              then you have something really really wrong with you. Mark Hammil,
              though, did a very good job voicing him in the animated series. I
              like Mark Hammil.</p>

          <div id="column2" class="col-xs-4"><h1>Blah! Blah!</h1>
            <p>I'd just post some lorem ipsum here but really I enjoy the typing
              practice, so I'll just keep writing the garbage. How's the weather
              where you are? Here it's hot, but getting cooler. The class I am
              taking is going alright and I'm liking how things are going.
              Typing is pretty fun. Maybe I should give the dvorak keyboard a
              try. I don't know.</p>

          <div id="column3" class="col-xs-4"><h1>Poop!</h1>
            Haha. Poop. Funny word, poop. The emoji for it is kinda funny too.
            For the longest time I thought that emoji was soft serve ice cream.
            But it's not. It's poop. With eyes. And a mouth. How weird is that?

            <h1>Suezy Sue</h1>
            <p>Suezy Sue loves sports. She really loves them. Just goes all out for sports. She plays them. She watches them. She works them. She loves sports. Really really loves them. Growling.</p>

            <h1>Bobby Boy</h1>
            <p>Bobby Boy is a douchebag. No one likes Bobby Boy. No one likes his stupid thick-rimmed glasses. No one likes his hipster beard. And there is definitely no one who likes his dumb fixy bicycle. But for some reason we can't fire this stupid guy. Arrrgh.</p>
