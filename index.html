            <p>Right now I am lauging at you because I think you are funny and
              I think everyone is funny. The whole world is funny. Some folks
              might think I like The Joker for some reason, but really that
              guy is a psychotic asshole. No one likes that guy. And if you do,
              then you have something really really wrong with you. Mark Hammil,
              though, did a very good job voicing him in the animated series. I
              like Mark Hammil.</p>

          <div id="column2" class="col-xs-4"><h1>Blah! Blah!</h1>
            <p>I'd just post some lorem ipsum here but really I enjoy the typing
              practice, so I'll just keep writing the garbage. How's the weather
              where you are? Here it's hot, but getting cooler. The class I am
              taking is going alright and I'm liking how things are going.
              Typing is pretty fun. Maybe I should give the dvorak keyboard a
              try. I don't know.</p>

          <div id="column3" class="col-xs-4"><h1>Poop!</h1>
            Haha. Poop. Funny word, poop. The emoji for it is kinda funny too.
            for the longest time I thought that emoji was soft serve ice cream.
            But it's not. It's poop. With eyes. And a mouth. How weird is that?
